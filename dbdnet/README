DBD::Informix --  an Informix interface for Perl 5 using DBI.

WARNING: THIS IS ALPHA SOFTWARE. IT IS POSSIBLY UNRELIABLE!

BEFORE BUILDING, TESTING AND INSTALLING this you will need to:

    Build, test and install Perl 5.
    It is very important to test it and install it!

*** NOTE: *** perl5 MUST BE INSTALLED TO VERSION 5.003 AT LEAST! ***

    Build, test and install the DBI module.
    It is very important to test it and install it!

BUILDING

    If Perl5 is installed do:

	perl Makefile.PL

    and answer the questions. The script will use your responses to attempt to
    work out what it needs to build the module.

    If Perl5 is NOT installed install it, and come back here later!

    Then do:

	make
	make install
	make test

If it fails horribly, see below.

Do NOT hand edit the generated Makefile unless you are completely sure
you understand the implications! Always try to make changes via the
Makefile.PL command line and/or editing the Makefile.PL.

You should never need to make any changes. If you do *please* let me
know so that I can try to make it automatic in a later release.

KNOWN PROBLEMS:

	o Make'ing generally fails first time around with a message like:

		In file included from dbdimp.ec:21:
                Informix.h:5: DBIXS.h: No such file or directory
                *** Error code 1

	  Just type 'make' immediately. It should complete without further
	  problems.

IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS:

Firstly, check the Frequently Asked Questions, Known Bugs and any other
pertinent documents at:

	http://www.hermetica.com/technologia/DBI

If this does *not* resolve your problem, please post details to 
perldb-interest@fugue.com and CC them to me at descarte@hermetica.com.  
Please include:

1. A complete log of a complete build, e.g.:

	perl Makefile.PL           (do a make realclean first)
	make
	./test.pl
	PERL_DBI_DEBUG=2 ./test.pl

2. Full details of which version of Informix/esql and Perl you're using.

3. The output of:
	perl -e 'use Config; print Config::myconfig()'

4. If you get a core dump, try to include a stack trace from it.
   If the stack trace mentions XS_DynaLoader_dl_load_file then rerun
   make test after setting the environment variable PERL_DL_DEBUG to 2.
   Similarly, get the Devel::CoreStack module and use it.

5. Please don't post problems to comp.lang.perl.misc or perl5-porters.
