DBD::NET is a perl module for remote database access. Some OS( like Linux)
doesn't have DB client support (Informix's I-NET, Orcale's SQLNET). Or you
don't want to pay extra money for DB client.

DBD::NET module consists of two components;
		- DBD::NET  module : A perl module follows DBI::DBD standard
		- DBD_NET agent : An agent process running on your DB server.

Currently, DBD::NET only have Informix agent. It should be easy to write
DB agent for other DBs. You only need to write 5-6 functoins.
